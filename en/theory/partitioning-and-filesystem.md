# Partitioning and Filesystem

Remember from where we introduced data, the space on your disk is just a singular series of 0’s and 1’s, and they can *only* be 0’s and 1’s. That is to say, the space allocation information is stored just in these 0’s and 1’s. Some parts of your disk store your files, and some parts store the space allocation information, all in the same, continuous, indifferent series of 0’s and 1’s of your disk. In this chapter, we set up levels of abstractions over this indifferent data to enable the familiar concepts we know.

There are two types of allocation: **partitioning** and **filesystem**. Partitioning is quite rudimentary: it defines usable segments of your disk space. Then, typically, a filesystem is established in each partition to contain files, usually in a tree structure.

On modern disks, data is accessed by logical blocks. **Logical blocks address**es (**LBA**) are linearally assigned, starting with 0. Most disks have a logical block size of 512 bytes.

## Partitioning

Partitioning is a type of abstraction about designating non-overlapping segments called **partitions**. A small **partition table** that stores this structure is usually put at the beginning of the disk, and the corresponding segments of data should be made accessible separately by an operating system.

This book only introduces the modern (not “legacy”) and common partitioning standard, the **GUID Partition Table** (**GPT**). A GPT typically takes the first 34 and last 33 (two copies) logical blocks to store 128 partitions, and this size can vary to accommodate more or fewer partitions. Each partition entry in the table contains the following information:

- *Partition type GUID.* Each partition type that exists has a standard GUID. Operating systems should recognize those that they support.
- *Partition GUID.* A unique GUID to identify a partition. There should not be duplicate partition GUIDs on a system.
- *Start LBA.* Specifies the start position. The partition includes the whole start logical block.
- *End LBA.* Specifies the end position. The partition includes the whole end logical block.
- *Attribute flags.* Specify special attributes.
- *Partition name.* Encoded in 36 units of UTF-16LE.

## Filesystem

Up to this point, there is no way to allocate many pieces of data of dynamic sizes. Our next type of abstraction, filesystem, is established (usually in a partition) to do this job. The most common filesystems give a tree structure.

Filesystem is already a very complicated topic on its own. But a general idea is that, somewhat similar to partitioning, there is a “file table” at a fixed location (usually the start of space), and it contains data such as where each file starts and ends, the directory structure, permissions, _etc._ The actual file data is put in the remaining space.

In such a framework, the fastest way to delete a file is to remove it from the “file table”, effectively marking the space it used to take up as unused. The fastest way to rename or move a file to a different directory is to change this information in the “file table”. Both actions do nothing with the actual file data, and this is exactly how most filesystems work. Usually, copying will actually copy the file data, overwriting some of the unused space, and modification happens in-place over the original data. However, these vary across filesystems so they need to be learned independently.

Because files can unpredictably be created or grow in size, it is inevitable that some files have their data separated into multiple segments. This is called **fragmentation**. While the filesystem can manage this correctly, too much of this happening impacts performance on storage devices that have low random performance.
